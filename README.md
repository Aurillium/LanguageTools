# LanguageTools
A Spigot API plugin to allow you to write plugins that get translations from the game.

## Features
* Get a player locale
* Translate items, entities, blocks, biomes, enchantments, potions and effects, advancements, (and pretty much anything else you could think of) to any language supported by Minecraft
* Languages can be overriden by the language in the server resource pack
* Custom languages can be implemented

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This plugin is unfinished and the `Translator` class does not work yet. Documentation is also virtually nonexistent at this point but this will be corrected once the plugin is complete. I have been doing final university assessments and exams but now that that's over this should be finished soon.
